Kotlin BluetoothLeGatt
===================================

Intro
-----
This is a Kotlin conversion/fork of [Android BluetootLeGatt](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt).

This was written for the ioTank101, which is project for the Hackster.io

[2017 Co-Making the Future competition](https://www.hackster.io/contests/2017chinausyoungmakercompetition ).

So far the DeviceControlActivity is converted to kotlin, making IoT development easy,

and the project builds in Android Studio 3.0.
