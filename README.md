Kotlin BluetoothLeGatt
===================================

Intro
-----
This is a Kotlin conversion/fork/port of [Android BluetootLeGatt](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt).

The code was ported so I could write the ioTank101 BLE app, which is a project for the Hackster.io [2017 Co-Making the Future competition](https://www.hackster.io/contests/2017chinausyoungmakercompetition ). The code is standalone however, and as close to the origional Android BluetoothLeGatt project as possible. 

Kotlin BLE makes IoT development easy.

project builds in Android Studio 3.0.
